# KiteSecurity Command Center — Project Prompt Pack

## One-line summary
Security and risk command center for Kite agent wallets and contracts.

## Product positioning
Scan wallets, preview risky signatures, analyze contract interactions, and guide incident response for agent systems on Kite.

## Why this exists
Autonomous agents introduce new risks: runaway spending, malicious contracts, risky approvals, abnormal transactions, and compromised wallets. This becomes the trust/safety layer.

## Repository name
`kite-security-command-center`

## Header subtitle
`SECURITY`

## Core routes
- `/`
- `/scan`
- `/wallet/:address`
- `/safesign`
- `/contracts/:address`
- `/incidents`
- `/revoke`
- `/settings`


## Core modules
1. **Wallet Risk Scanner** — Analyze wallet behavior for suspicious activity and risk factors.
2. **SafeSign Preview** — Decode proposed transactions before users sign.
3. **Contract Interaction Analyzer** — Analyze contracts and interactions for known risks.
4. **Incident Response Checklist** — Guided response for compromised/buggy agent wallets.
5. **Emergency Revoke / Freeze Center** — Central UI for pausing agents, revoking sessions, and creating revoke actions.

## API surface
- `POST /scan/wallet`
- `GET /scan/wallet/:address`
- `POST /safesign/preview`
- `GET /contracts/:address`
- `POST /incidents`
- `PATCH /incidents/:id`
- `POST /emergency-actions`


## Safety requirements
- Security scores are ESTIMATED, not guarantees
- Never say safe/unsafe absolutely
- No private keys
- Destructive actions require explicit confirmation and preview


## Build philosophy
This is not a small demo. Build it as a serious productivity platform for Kite AI agents. Every UI screen must move the user toward a real workflow, decision, payment, approval, or operational outcome.

# STAGE_00_CONTEXT_AND_REPO_SETUP.md

# Stage 00 — Context and Repo Setup for KiteSecurity Command Center

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Create the initial monorepo for **KiteSecurity Command Center**: Security and risk command center for Kite agent wallets and contracts.

This stage should establish a clean foundation only. Do not build all product modules yet.

## Product constraints
- Product name: `KiteSecurity Command Center`
- Repo name: `kite-security-command-center`
- Header subtitle: `SECURITY`
- Positioning: Scan wallets, preview risky signatures, analyze contract interactions, and guide incident response for agent systems on Kite.

## Required monorepo structure

Create this structure:

```txt
packages/web/          Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 frontend
packages/api/          Hono API server
packages/worker/       background jobs and queues
packages/core/         pure TypeScript domain logic
packages/connectors/   KiteScan, RPC, webhook, LLM, wallet/API connectors
```

Only add `packages/contracts/` if a later stage explicitly needs contracts.

## Frontend requirements
- Vite React TypeScript project under `packages/web`.
- Tailwind v4 using inline `@theme` in CSS.
- Copy the design values from `THEME.md` exactly.
- Add Geist and Geist Mono Google font links in `index.html`.
- Add shared components:
  - `SiteHeader`
  - `SiteFooter`
  - `KiteLogo`
  - `AddressDisplay`
  - `PreviewBadge`
  - `StatusBadge`
  - `MonoValue`
  - `EmptyState`
  - `ErrorState`
- Build a basic landing page with hero, product promise, module cards, and PREVIEW honesty banner.

## Backend requirements
- Hono API in `packages/api`.
- Health route: `GET /health` returns `{ ok: true, service: "kite-security-command-center" }`.
- Shared environment loader with `.env.example`.
- Add CORS configured for local web dev.

## Core package requirements
- Add `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- Add common types: `KiteAddress`, `TxHash`, `ISODate`, `RiskLevel`, `PreviewStatus`.
- Add validators for EVM address and tx hash.

## Connector package requirements
- Add Kite chain constants.
- Add KiteScan API base helper.
- Add cached fetch helper with TTL.
- Add placeholder RPC client helper using viem.

## Deliverables
- Full monorepo initialized.
- Root `package.json` with pnpm workspaces.
- Root `README.md` with what the product does.
- `.env.example` for all packages.
- Basic dev scripts:
  - `pnpm dev`
  - `pnpm -r typecheck`
  - `pnpm -r test`
  - `pnpm -r lint`

## Acceptance criteria
- Web app renders the landing page.
- API health route works.
- TypeScript builds.
- No forbidden fonts/colors.
- README clearly says what is real and what is PREVIEW.

## Required verification

Run these commands and fix all issues before ending the stage:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint || true
pnpm -r test || true
grep -rn "Instrument\|font-instrument\|font-serif" packages/web/src packages/web/index.html || true
grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.

# STAGE_01_DATABASE_AND_TYPES.md

# Stage 01 — Database and Domain Types for KiteSecurity Command Center

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Design and implement the domain model, database schema, migrations, seed data, and TypeScript types for **KiteSecurity Command Center**.

Do not build final UI screens yet. Build the data foundation that later stages will use.

## Required entities from PRD
Implement types and database tables for these domain objects:

- `WalletScan{id, address, risk_score, factors_json, scanned_at}`
- `RiskFinding{id, scan_id, severity, title, description, evidence_json}`
- `SignPreview{id, owner_address, tx_json, decoded_json, risk_level, findings_json, created_at}`
- `ContractProfile{id, address, name, verified_status, first_seen, last_seen, stats_json}`
- `ContractFinding{id, contract_address, severity, title, evidence_json}`
- `Incident{id, title, severity, status, affected_address, created_at, closed_at}`
- `IncidentStep{id, incident_id, title, status, notes, completed_at}`
- `EmergencyAction{id, incident_id, type, target_address, payload_json, status, created_at}`


## Database choice
Use SQLite for local MVP with Drizzle ORM or a clean query layer. Keep the schema portable so it can move to Postgres later.

## Required files

```txt
packages/core/src/types.ts
packages/core/src/validation.ts
packages/core/src/errors.ts
packages/api/src/db/schema.ts
packages/api/src/db/client.ts
packages/api/src/db/migrate.ts
packages/api/src/db/seed.ts
packages/api/src/repositories/
```

## Schema requirements
- Every table must have `id`, `created_at`, and where useful `updated_at`.
- Store addresses lowercase, but preserve display formatting in UI.
- Use JSON columns for flexible config payloads, but validate shape at API boundaries.
- Add indexes for address, status, created_at, foreign keys, and tx_hash where relevant.
- Add uniqueness constraints where duplicates would be dangerous.
- Add status enums in TypeScript and database-safe string values.

## TypeScript requirements
- Define strict types for every core entity.
- Define create/update input types separately from persisted entity types.
- Add Zod schemas for API request validation.
- Add helper functions for validating Kite addresses, tx hashes, amounts, and URLs.

## Seed data
Add realistic local seed data for demo mode:
- At least 3 users/owners.
- At least 5 main entities for the product.
- At least 10 events/logs/history rows where relevant.
- Seeded Kite-like addresses must be valid `0x` addresses.
- Mark all fake/demo records with `demo: true` or a clear `[MOCK]` label field.

## Acceptance criteria
- Migrations run from a clean database.
- Seed script populates useful demo data.
- API can import repositories without circular dependencies.
- Domain types are exported from `packages/core`.
- No UI claims seeded mock data is real.

## Required verification

Run these commands and fix all issues before ending the stage:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint || true
pnpm -r test || true
grep -rn "Instrument\|font-instrument\|font-serif" packages/web/src packages/web/index.html || true
grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.

```ts
{ ok: true, data: unknown, request_id: string }
```

- Add pagination to list endpoints using `limit`, `cursor`, or `page`.
- Add filters for status/date/address where useful.
- Add basic local auth placeholder based on `x-demo-owner-address` header, but keep it clearly marked as demo-only.
- Do not implement insecure production auth in this stage.

## Product-specific behavior

# Stage 03 — Worker and Agent Runtime for KiteSecurity Command Center

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Build the background worker/runtime layer for **KiteSecurity Command Center**. This product should feel productive and agentic, not just CRUD screens.

## Worker package structure

```txt
packages/worker/src/index.ts
packages/worker/src/queue.ts
packages/worker/src/jobs/
packages/worker/src/scheduler.ts
packages/worker/src/logger.ts
packages/worker/src/config.ts
```

## Core runtime requirements
- Implement a simple durable job queue abstraction.
- Local MVP can use SQLite polling or an in-memory queue with persistent job table.
- Every job has `id`, `type`, `status`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`, `payload_json`, `last_error`, `created_at`, `run_at`, `finished_at`.
- Add exponential backoff helper.
- Add idempotency key support where a job can cause external effects.
- Add structured logs.

## Agentic requirements
Where this product needs AI/agent behavior, implement a provider abstraction:

```ts
interface AgentModelProvider {
  generateObject<T>(input: AgentPromptInput<T>): Promise<AgentResult<T>>;
  generateText(input: AgentTextInput): Promise<AgentTextResult>;
}
```

- Add a mock provider for local development.
- Add environment placeholders for real LLM provider later.
- Every AI output must be stored with prompt, model, input, output, and timestamp.
- Any action proposed by AI that can move funds or affect users must enter approval flow.

## Product-specific jobs
Create worker job stubs for each module:

- Wallet Risk Scanner
- SafeSign Preview
- Contract Interaction Analyzer
- Incident Response Checklist
- Emergency Revoke / Freeze Center


Each job should have:
- input schema,
- handler,
- success path,
- failure path,
- timeline/audit log write,
- unit test with mock data.

## Acceptance criteria
- Worker starts locally.
- Worker can process at least one seeded/demo job.
- Failed jobs retry and eventually mark failed.
- Job logs are visible through API or database.
- AI/mock provider outputs are stored, not hidden.

```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.

# STAGE_10_KITE_WALLET_AND_PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md

# Stage 10 — Kite Wallet and Payment Integration for KiteSecurity Command Center

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Add safe Kite chain integration to **KiteSecurity Command Center**. This stage should wire KiteScan, RPC, wallet connection, address views, tx verification, and payment-safety patterns where relevant.

## Required connector files

```txt
packages/connectors/src/kite-chain.ts
packages/connectors/src/kitescan.ts
packages/connectors/src/rpc.ts
packages/connectors/src/payment-verifier.ts
packages/connectors/src/address.ts
packages/web/src/lib/wallet.ts
packages/web/src/lib/chains.ts
```

## Kite constants
Use these defaults:

```txt
Mainnet RPC: https://rpc.gokite.ai/
Mainnet Chain ID: 2366
Mainnet Explorer: https://kitescan.ai/
Mainnet API: https://kitescan.ai/api/v2/
Testnet RPC: https://rpc-testnet.gokite.ai/
Testnet Chain ID: 2368
Native token: KITE, 18 decimals
Testnet USDT: 0x0fF5393387ad2f9f691FD6Fd28e07E3969e27e63, 18 decimals
```

## Wallet connection
- Add wagmi + RainbowKit only if this product needs wallet connection.
- Customize RainbowKit theme to sand accent, not default blue/violet.
- Add network switch UI for mainnet/testnet when appropriate.
- Never store private keys.

## Payment verification pattern
If the product accepts payment tx hashes, implement:

1. Fetch transaction receipt by hash.
2. Confirm receipt status success.
3. Confirm chain/network.
4. For ERC-20 payment, parse Transfer logs.
5. Verify token contract address.
6. Verify recipient address.
7. Verify amount is greater than or equal to expected amount.
8. Store verification result.
9. Reject invalid tx with clear reason.
10. Never grant access from client-claimed payment alone.

## UI integration
- Every address links to KiteScan.
- Every tx hash links to KiteScan.
- Use `font-mono` for address/hash/amount/block.
- Mark any unverified payment as PENDING or UNVERIFIED.
- Mark any mock/demo payment as `[MOCK]`.

## Product-specific integration points
- Wallet Risk Scanner
- SafeSign Preview
- Contract Interaction Analyzer
- Incident Response Checklist
- Emergency Revoke / Freeze Center


For each module, identify whether it needs:
- address lookup,
- tx hash lookup,
- token balance,
- payment verification,
- wallet approval,
- receipt display,
- explorer links.

## Acceptance criteria
- KiteScan client can fetch latest transactions or address data in demo mode.
- Payment verifier has unit tests for valid, invalid, wrong-recipient, wrong-token, and insufficient-amount cases using mocked receipts.
- Wallet UI does not use forbidden RainbowKit colors.
- No mainnet payment feature is presented as production-ready unless token/contract addresses are confirmed.

grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.
